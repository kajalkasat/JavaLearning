1. difference between final, finally and finalize 
    -> final : modifier for classes, methods and variables 
    -> finally : block assoiated with try catch 
        try
        {
            // risky code
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // code handled 
        }
        finally{
            // clean up code
        }
    -> finalize : garbage collection 

2. difference between string and string buffer 
    -> string objects are immutable 
    -> string buffer objects are mutable 

3. difference between string buffer and string builder 
    -> string buffer is synchronized and thread safe, only 1 thread can operate on it 
    when that process is completed only the next thread can be operated on, hence low performance
    -> string builder is non-synchronized and not thread safe 
    -> string builder is better performance 

4. difference between interface, abstract class and concrete class 
    -> interface : when we have no internal implementation idea, but only requirement
    -> abstract class : when we have partial implementation idea 
    -> concrete class : when we have full implementation idea 

5. difference between interface and abstract class (VVVV important)
