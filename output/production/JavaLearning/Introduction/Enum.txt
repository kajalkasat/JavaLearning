Enums are used to represent a group of constants as a single type.
Eg : enum Pen {
    reynolds, cello, parker; --> ";" is not mandatory
}

Internally:
class Pen{

}
reynolds, cello, parker :
-> are all objects of the class Pen 
-> public static final 
public static final Pen reynolds = new Pen();

every enum constant is static, hence 
Pen p = Pen.reynolds
sysout(p) gives the value inside this constant
toString() is overriden to give a valid output, by default its set to return the name of the constant 

declaration : inside class, outside class, NOT inside method (throws compile time error)

Inheritance is not applicable to enum, as enum is final and hence cannot be extended
although enums can implement interfaces
