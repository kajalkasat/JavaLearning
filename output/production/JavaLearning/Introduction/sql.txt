highest salarty : select max(salary) from employee;
secodn highest : select max(salary) from employee where salary <> select max(salary) from employee;
<> - not equal to

nth highest :
select id,salary from employee e1 where N-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary)

last 3 records :

to get last 3 records : temp = (select * from employee order by emp id desc limit 3)

final ans = select * from temp order by emp id asc;
query : select * from (select * from employee order by emp id desc limit 3) order by emp id asc;
