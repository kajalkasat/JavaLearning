class se related hota hain
memory management ke liye hota hain 
if made a member static, then its copy is created only at class level, not for the objects

if static blocks are there, then static blocks in their code written order would be executed and then main()

static keyword for these members only : variabes, methods, blocks(static block) and nested class 

static CANNOT be used inside non-static inner type 

Top level class cannot be static, nested class can be static 
    -> why make the inner class static ?
        -> because, if the inner class is static we can access it like its present outside 

static blocks ? 
    -> few fields are not initialised inside main(), we want to initialise them by the time we reach main()
    -> as all the static blocks will be executed before main(), these fields would be initialised
