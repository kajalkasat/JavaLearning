ArrayList(class) implement List(I) extends Collection(I) 

List:
-> duplicates are allowed
-> order of display is as the order of input 

ArrayList:
-> these are dynamic arrays / resizeable arrays 
-> default size is 10
-> list arr = {1,2,3,4,5} (consider this as list definition)
-> if we want to add 6 to arr : arr.add(6)
then the new arr will be created and copied element by element into a new array, and then 6 will be appended
size of new arraylist : (currentsize * (3/2) ) + 1
-> once this new arr got created, the previous one will be available for garbage collection 
-> arr.add(null) --> null insertion is possible 
-> we can insert heterogenous elements (data type of elements can be different) 
-> pros ; retireving values, as ArrayList(Class) internally implements random access interface(I), so 
arr.get(1) and arr.get(1000) will both take the same time
-> cons : insertion and deletion, as it using shift operation arr.add(1,30) will add at 1st index,
but the remaining indexes are shifted by 1 position, thus making it time consuming
